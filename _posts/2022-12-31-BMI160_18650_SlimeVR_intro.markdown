# **SLIME VR BMI160 trackers with 18650 PSU**

### The idea behind this project:

Vive trackers are not only expensive but also require either harmounting base stations to the wall or using tripods. This can ultimately
shrink the allowed usable space for the end-user. it's also very expensive for what I personally view as a very simple concept. For a while
I thought about my experience with using flight controllers in building, programming, and flying FPV quadcopters and a large part of the reasoning
for why these quadcopters can fly the way that they do is because of the IMUs onboard these flight controllers. An IMU is an "Inertial Measurement Unit"
these are found in smartphones, game controllers, and vehicles. Luckily an open source project known as Slime VR created a software used specifically for VR gaming
that utilizes these IMUs and can connect to any computer or smartphone running their server via 2.4ghz Wi-Fi radio connection. They do have a product available for purchase,
but these are made to order and wait times for batches have gotten a bit extreme. So I decided instead of waiting for the next batch why not just build them myself?
I reasearched pros and cons of each compenent, watched some demonstrations and even comparisons on how each component works, and even did some cost analysis on how expensive
or inexpensive of a product could be built that would still deliver a desireable experience for the end-user. 

### Goals for this project:

- *Create something easy to replicate*
- *has to be serviceable for maintenance/repair by the end-user*
- *parts have to be readily available*
- *fit and finish needs to be comfortable*
- *needs to be more convenient to use than available alternatives*
- *cost needs to be reasonable*
- *needs to function properly*

### Components:

- 18650 batteries x5 (MXJO 2500mah 20A $4.99 / $24.95)
- 18650 sleds ($7.99)
- BMI160 IMU x5 ($6.79 / $33.95)
- Wemos D1 mini ($14.99)
- TP4056 charging board ($10.99)
- SS22F32 switches ($10.69)
- 1N5817 diodes ($6.99)
- 180k ohm resistors ($5.49)
- 24g wire ($11.48)
- 5-pin JST connectors ($8.59)
- Custom PCBs from JST PCB ($15)
- velcro straps ($9.99)
- 3D printer/injection mold access

**total cost: $161.10**

This is the cost break down of a core set meeaning this is the absolute base number of trackers needed to run slime VR
the wait time for these components took a week and a half to arrive to my door after initial order. at the time of writing this, and
official core set directly from slimeVR on crowd supply goes for **$173** with an **ETA shipment time of 17 weeks from order.**
for 3 vive trackers, straps, and 2 base stations the absolute lowest price I could find this bundled for was **$785.98** with an **ETA shipment
time of a week and a half to two weeks.** The official set from SlimeVR is priced quite fair in comparison but the wait time seemed very long to recieve
the product ordered. The Vive trackers are more expensive than the headset I'm even using and they don't seem very convenient for travel or different
spaces seeing as they require line of sight for operation. For people like myself who ran into this same issue at this current point in time
the DIY approach seems to be the best option for affordable and convenient motion capture tracking.

In the next post I will go over the process of building the trackers after receiving all the required components.
